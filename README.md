## WARNING
this (probably) won't work for browsers other than chrome, due to the aes key being (possibly) different. you will have to change this "sxxuJBrIRnKNqcH6xJNmUc/7lE0UOrgWJ2vMbaAoR4c=" string to whatever the browser has in their "elevator_service.exe" binary as the hardcoded string. how do you find that string you might ask, and to that ill say no clue, good luck!
